# Adout Pride and Prejudice

'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife'.

This is the classic beginning of Jane Austen's masterpiece Pride and Prejudice.

Is this right?

Of course not, to be biased and self-righteous.

Putting a stupid sentence at the beginning of the novel, how can it form a classic effect?

The novel begins in many ways. Straight to the point, drinking out of thin air, and eloquently speaking, and so on.

Austin began with what Nabokov called a "smiley" irony.

Of course, when we say "Pride and Prejudice", the plot itself is also full of irony.

For example, when Darcy first met Elizabeth, she said that she was okay, but she was not good-looking enough, and couldn't be attracted to herself - and finally married Elizabeth, which was really fragrant.

As the title suggests, many characters in the book have their own "Pride and Prejudice", and the whole book is also light and ironic, teasing those characters who are full of bachelors, marriages, and property.

Whoever joked that many aunts and wives in Austen's novels think about their daughter's "marriageability" every day, which is also wonderful.

With a sarcasm, as the beginning of a novel full of sarcasm, the outline is very good.

But why is this sarcasm so powerful?

The beginning of this sentence, of course, is not Austen's heart, but imitating the logic of her characters.

**To ridicule a very absurd thing, you only need to reproduce the absurdity directly.**

Austen has a classic mocking skill called free indirect quotation - she will speak in the narrative, directly imitating the characters she writes about.

For example, in the following paragraph, Mrs. Ben and the like, running around pondering and trying to rope in Mr. Bin.

> Finally they had no choice but to listen to indirect information from their neighbor, Mrs. Lucas. Her reports were all good. Sir William was said to be very fond of him. He was very young, exceptionally good-looking, extremely modest, and, most importantly, he was planning to invite a large group of guests to the next ball. **This could not be better**; the love of dancing is a step towards love; everyone is passionately hoping to get Mr. Bingley's heart.

The phrase "it could not have been better" is not in Austen's mind, but in the minds of Mrs. Bennett.

The narration of the narrator, suddenly using the tone of the characters in the pen, is very funny.

**Mr. Lu Xun has a piece called "Rei Shui "**, about Dayu's treatment of water. It is about the people's suffering, but the officials don't care, to mirror the Great Yu who wants to get serious about practical matters.

The novel begins with.

> The people of Master Shun were not all crowded on the tops of the hills exposed to the water, some were tied to the tops of trees, some were sitting on wooden rows, and some of them had small wooden shelters on them, ** which looked very poetic from the shore. **

The phrase "rich in poetic interest" is full of mockery when it says that the suffering people are "rich in poetic interest.

Is it Mr. Lu Xun himself who thinks so? Anyone who has read the novel knows that of course not.

Do the people think so? Of course not.

It is Mr. Lu Xun who is imitating those officials who are standing around talking. This one sentence sets the tone of the first half of "Water for Thought".

It is similar to Austen's ironic opening, right?

**The first half of the story is about a woman who has been in love with a man for years. Bai Liusu went back to Shanghai after a period of contact with Fan Liuyuan, so her feudal family peeped in while wondering.

> The White House has already had an ear to the gods and found out that Miss Six has been living with Fan Liuyuan in Hong Kong. Now she has been playing with others for more than a month and has returned as if nothing had happened, clearly intent on disgracing the White family. The first thing you need to do is to get the money. Really got the money, but also will not be noiseless home to come, obviously did not get him what benefits. Originally, a woman on the man's pawn, should die; woman to the man on, it is more adulterous; ** If a woman wants to give when to the man and failed, but on the other hand, it is a double material obscene evil **, kill her also tainted the knife.

The phrase "if a woman wants to give when to a man and failed, but instead fell for someone else's pawn, that is double the lust and evil", without quotation marks in the narrative, is the perfect mockery of the concept of the White House.

So cluck, **to mock a person, just repeat his absurd logic** on the line - also considered reductio ad absurdum.

------

As for the statement "It has become a universally accepted truth that every bachelor who has property must marry a wife" - what is the most ironic point?

You can try to remove the words ""**must, all, universally accepted**" - if you remove these words, it starts with.

"It has become a truth, that a single man with property needs to marry a wife."

It is a truth, that a single man in possession of a good fortune is in want of a wife.

That's not quite true, but the mockery is not as strong as before.

You must have seen.

**The funniest thing is precisely those categorical and self-righteous words, truth universally, must, "necessarily, wherever, universally recognized." **

**Putting narrow prejudice for truth. **

This technique is so brilliant that many of its predecessors have since used it ironically.

In Qian Zhongshu's "The Siege", the pedantic Fang Hongjian's father had a big nonsense line.

> The woman had a baby with a car driver and came out as a nurse, this kind of woman is **all** toxic and cannot feed children.

If the word "all" is removed from this sentence, it is not so strong mockery.

In Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q", it is also.

> The Chinese men, most of them could have been sages, but unfortunately **all** of them were ruined by women. The Shang Dynasty is the death of Daji; the Zhou Dynasty is the Baosi spoiled; Qin ...... although the history is not clear, we also assume that he because of women, may not be very wrong; and Dong Zhuo but ** indeed ** to the mink cicada killed.

"All, indeed", the funny point on these words.

------

So, probably, Austen, Qian Zhongshu, Zhang Eiling and Mr. Lu Xun, which were born in the 18th century, 19th century and 20th century, different backgrounds and different languages, intelligent and poisonous, but coincidentally understand this truth: **The most absurdly funny lines.

**The most absurdly funny lines are often those arrogant, self-righteous, full of big, but not when the nail-biting harsh words, "all, necessarily, the world recognized." **

** It's easy to be embarrassed when the words are full and there's no room for spin. **

** So just repeating that kind of talk is the perfect irony. **
