# About Personal Preference

Gazing at the world, chasing phenomena, one soon feels dizzy, so I feel. Of course there are people who can keep gazing for a long time, and I am envious of this. Such people believe that they are observing the world, and I have long since stopped believing in such claims.

Each person's heart is different. Again, when faced with a photo of a pretty girl, a girl looks over and all these places - hair, clothing, eyeliner, blush - are marked red and highlighted; a boy looks over and the focus is all on one face, constantly calculating proportions and relative positions. So, what is observation? There is no observation, only projection. What one wants and cares about inside oneself, one projects them into the external world and then goes looking for them. How else can one explain what one will pay special attention to, what one will be particularly sensitive to?

So when gazing at the world, one is gazing at one's own inner projection, finding its existence in every corner of the world, finding its manifestation in all phenomena. That is certainly a very tiring thing. If a person is convinced in his heart that money is supreme, then everything he sees in the world has a price tag on it, and he needs to identify it one by one. All phenomena and actions are the flow of money, and he needs to see this flow for what it is. How can one not feel dizzy when gazing continuously at countless targets and movements in this way?

People say that the world makes them feel bad when they look at it, and that is because they have gazed at it for too long. One needs to take one's gaze back, back to one's side, back to the near cut, back to one's inner world. But one's own company with oneself may be far more unbearable than gazing at the world. And so, one needs to focus on what is around oneself, and that place is personal preference.

Play cards, sing, paint, read, travel, put together Lego, listen to music, if developed into a personal hobby, all should have experienced one thing, that is, immersed in it is easy to forget the passage of time. Not surprisingly, time itself is not an entity, but a psychological feeling. We need to be aware of the passage of time from the changes in the external world, but when one focuses on one's personal hobby, no matter what the project is, one is actually cutting off most of the connection between oneself and the external world, and it is naturally not easy to notice the passage of time.

And then personal hobbies are neutral and basically impossible to project. The world is too big, there are too many things, and one can always keep finding projections that fit inside, proving over and over again that one has the right judgment, the right emotions, the right feelings. Personal preference is not. Personal preference is a very limited and small thing, your intention, your observation is no matter how strong, you pick up a bad hand is a bad hand, it does not listen to you at all, it has its own ideas. You think the cards fall raw hands, fresh hands will be good; you think last night to eat fast, today should be good hands. The card does not bother to pay attention to you, what should be the face of the card is still what the face of the card, the projection function failed. Unlike you face the world, you internally think that everyone is targeting yourself, then you can immediately observe countless instances of targeting you.

Personal preferences are also controllable. The world is not controllable, the world is an all-night movie theater. But whenever you sit there, scene after scene will be screened continuously before your eyes, endlessly. The projector is in your own mind, projecting light and shadow externally, and you want to stop, you can't stop, you just keep watching with your eyes wide open. You do know that it is a small existence, you do know that it has a limited range of variation, and you do expect it to bring much joy and satisfaction. None of it is big, but it is enough for the individual. When everything is under control, one's mind does not easily fall into frenzy, but becomes very peaceful. How much can happen on a card table a chessboard a watering hole a stack of papers a CD and how much can be possible? Even when you travel, when you step into a city as a traveler, all the possibilities of life immediately collapse into a limited number of things, the ones that suit the traveler.

There has to be some personal hobby that helps you detach from the outside world and rest for a while in the small world in front of you. Which again has a little fun, which avoids the awkwardness of spending time with yourself. In the ordinary mode, a bad feeling arises in a person's mind, and then a bad thought arises, rising to a bad idea. At this point he looks outward and immediately finds a bunch of bad existences and bad phenomena that corroborate his bad thought. The bad thought returns inside, enhancing the bad feeling, giving rise to an even worse thought, rising to an even worse thought ...... It is a continuous cycle of reinforcement until one feels exhausted in the face of the world.

Personal hobbies can cut off this cycle and turn one's life into a simple pattern. Yes, personal hobbies consume time and money, and this is often criticized, with an even harsher criticism added: it's an escape from reality. So how do you face reality and the world? By turning off the internal projector, stopping the projection, and observing truthfully with an unbiased attitude and without personal bias. The problem is that most people can't do that. Observing the outside world also consumes time and money, but it consumes mental energy. This is not the case with personal hobbies, which bring a little pleasure, a little satisfaction, a little rest, a little recharging process.

How to understand those old pictures of people reading or playing the piano on the ruins of war? A noble spiritual world? Optimism? No. Sitting on the edge of rubble and crumbling buildings, one begins to read or to play the piano, and everything around one ceases to exist. One is thus given a moment of respite from the turmoil before him and returns to himself. In the midst of the external world, over which he has no control, he has more or less a book, a violin that is reliable, that he can control, and from which he can derive pleasure and beauty. When he put down the book, put away the strings, and faced the world again, at least he had a peaceful heart, and because of the joy and beauty, hope existed in this peaceful heart.
